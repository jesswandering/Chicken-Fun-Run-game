Why did the chicken cross the road? 

To get to the other side!

Chicken Fun Run is just like the classic arcade game "Frogger."  Sure to be a classic among retro gaming enthusiasts!

Haven't heard of "Frogger"? No worries, it's simple.  The player controls a chicken who must navigate through a busy road to reach home on the other side.  The play has to avoid oncoming cars that move across the screen.  

The game is played on a 2D platform with the chicken at the side of the screen with the obstacles moving from bottom to top.  The player must move the chicken forward and backward, left and right, to avoid getting hit by the cars.  

To play, use your keyboard arrows to move the chicken up and down, left and right.
